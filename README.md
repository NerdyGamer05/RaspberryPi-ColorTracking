# Color Tracking with a Raspberry Pi
A script that uses OpenCV to identify colors in a Raspberry Pi camera feed. The color can be set using RGB sliders, and the centriod of all of the positions of that color is drawn as a circle on the camera feed.

The relative position of the centriod from the center of the camera feed is saved and displayed on the screen.

You can also cycle modes to view the raw, thresholding, and thresholding w/ contours feed.
